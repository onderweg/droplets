# Droplets: a simple Digital Ocean Droplet manager

Experimental hybrid app (HTML/JS wrapped in a native app with WKWebview), build with Swift.
I chose to use the Digital Ocean API as a use case.

Idea:

- Run local webserver in nodejs, which serves static files
- Load static site, build with AngularJS, from webview

The app shows your Digital Ocean droplets.

Consider this an alpha version. This project is not activly maintained. I make no guarantees or warranties whatsoever.

##Building/Running

- Make sure NodeJS is installed and runnable from `/usr/local/bin/node`. A NodeJS script serves statics files to the WKWebview in the app.
- Build the project in XCode.
- After startup, you need to enter your Digital Ocean oAuth token in the settings screen (cog wheel icon). You need a token with read+write access.
